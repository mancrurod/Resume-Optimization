# ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

**Resume Optimization** is a modular ETL-style pipeline designed to adapt `.docx` resumes to specific job descriptions using LLMs like OpenAI GPT-4o-mini or Gemini.

It converts your original resume to Markdown, generates a prompt tailored to a job description, adapts the resume with AI, allows HTML editing, and exports a polished PDF â€” all in one flow.

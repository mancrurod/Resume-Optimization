# ðŸ“„ Resume Optimization

Welcome to **Resume Optimization** â€” a modular Python project that turns your humble `.docx` resume into a lean, clean, ATS-beating machine. With the help of LLMs, Markdown, and just enough automation to make it magic, your CV will finally look like it belongs in 2025.

## ðŸš€ What This Project Does

1. **Converts** your `.docx` resume to structured `Markdown`.
2. **Adapts** the content using GPT-4o-mini to better match a job description (optionally).
3. **Exports** the adapted Markdown to `HTML` and `PDF`, with editable HTML styling.
4. **Lets you edit** the final HTML with a built-in visual editor (in PyQt5).
5. **Keeps things modular**, so you can swap in different models, templates or flows.

## ðŸ¤– How It Works

### 1. Convert
Turn `.docx` into Markdown with proper headings, bullet points, and structure â€” even if your original Word doc was a mess.  
*Spoiler: It probably was.*

```bash
python convert_to_md.py
```

### 2. Adapt (Optional)
Feed the Markdown into GPT-4o-mini and let the AI highlight what recruiters want to see. Buzzwords included, guilt-free.

```bash
python adapt_cv.py --job-description job.txt
```

### 3. Export & Edit
Generate beautiful HTML + PDF files with typographic control. Then tweak the HTML visually with a full WYSIWYG editor.

```bash
python export_resume.py
```

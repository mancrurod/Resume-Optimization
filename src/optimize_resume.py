I have a resume in Markdown format and a job description. Your task is to **refine and tailor my resume** to closely match the job requirements while ensuring it remains professional, well-structured, and ATS-friendly. Below are the details. You MUST follow the instructions carefully.

### **Key Objectives:**  
- Align my resume with the job description by emphasizing **relevant skills, experiences, and achievements**.  
- **Incorporate** keywords and phrases from the job posting to improve ATS compatibility.  
- **Enhance bullet points** by making them **quantifiable** and **impact-driven**.  
- Ensure **clarity, conciseness, and a professional tone**.  
- Maintain the **Markdown format**, preserving proper spacing, bullet points, and hyperlinks.  
- **Keep job and education dates** on the **same line**, right after the job title or degree, using a clear separator like `¬∑`.  
- Format each **job title** AND **degree** as: **Title**, *Institution* ¬∑ Dates, keeping everything on the same line.  
- If my **education or experience does not fully match** the job description, identify and emphasize **transferable skills** that demonstrate my ability to perform the role effectively.

### **Language Guidelines:**  
- If **both** the resume and job description are in **Spanish**, return the revised resume in **Spanish**.  
- If **both** the resume and job description are in **English**, return the revised resume in **English**.  

### **Input Data:**  
#### **Resume (Markdown format):**  
{md_resume}  

#### **Job Description:**  
{job_description}  

### **Expected Output:**  
- Return the **optimized resume in Markdown**, ensuring it is refined according to the outlined objectives.  
- **Do not enclose the output in code blocks (` ``` `), return it as plain Markdown content.**
- Example for **Title**, *Institution* ¬∑ Dates: **M√°ster en Data Science & IA**, *Evolve Academy* ¬∑ Enero 2025 - Junio 2025
